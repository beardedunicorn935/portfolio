           <p> About Me---So Who am I? My name is Chris and I started my coding journey in january  of 2023. I never thought
            that I would enjoy it as much as I do but its alot of fun. Im hoping to get to where I know enough that I can get 
            paid to do it. This is a portfolio page that I have built to store some of the bigger projects that I have created as I continue
            learning coding and full-stack development.
